# 🖥️ WindowsConsole  
An abstract, Ncurses-inspired Windows console API designed to simplify the development of console applications.  

## ✨ Overview  
WindowsConsole provides a lightweight framework for building interactive console programs on Windows.  
It abstracts away low-level WinAPI calls, making it easier to handle input, output, and screen management.  

Originally developed as the foundation for a **chess engine project**, this library can also be reused for other console-based applications.  

## ⚙️ Features  
- Simplified interface inspired by Ncurses  
- Wrapper around core **WinAPI** functions  
- Tools for managing screen buffers, input handling, and rendering  
- Lightweight and extendable for custom console applications  

## 🔧 Dependencies  
- Windows operating system  
- WinAPI (native)  

## 📌 Example Use Case  
- Used as the console rendering and input layer for a custom chess engine written in C
